	SCENE I. London. The palace.
	    Enter KING HENRY, LORD JOHN OF LANCASTER, the EARL of WESTMORELAND, SIR WALTER BLUNT, and others 

	KING HENRY IV

	    So shaken as we are, so wan with care,
	    Find we a time for frighted peace to pant,
	    And breathe short-winded accents of new broils
	    To be commenced in strands afar remote.
	    No more the thirsty entrance of this soil
	    Shall daub her lips with her own children's blood;
	    Nor more shall trenching war channel her fields,
	    Nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs
	    Of hostile paces: those opposed eyes,
	    Which, like the meteors of a troubled heaven,
	    All of one nature, of one substance bred,
	    Did lately meet in the intestine shock
	    And furious close of civil butchery
	    Shall now, in mutual well-beseeming ranks,
	    March all one way and be no more opposed
	    Against acquaintance, kindred and allies:
	    The edge of war, like an ill-sheathed knife,
	    No more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends,
	    As far as to the sepulchre of Christ,
	    Whose soldier now, under whose blessed cross
	    We are impressed and engaged to fight,
	    Forthwith a power of English shall we levy;
	    Whose arms were moulded in their mothers' womb
	    To chase these pagans in those holy fields
	    Over whose acres walk'd those blessed feet
	    Which fourteen hundred years ago were nail'd
	    For our advantage on the bitter cross.
	    But this our purpose now is twelve month old,
	    And bootless 'tis to tell you we will go:
	    Therefore we meet not now. Then let me hear
	    Of you, my gentle cousin Westmoreland,
	    What yesternight our council did decree
	    In forwarding this dear expedience.

	WESTMORELAND

	    My liege, this haste was hot in question,
	    And many limits of the charge set down
	    But yesternight: when all athwart there came
	    A post from Wales loaden with heavy news;
	    Whose worst was, that the noble Mortimer,
	    Leading the men of Herefordshire to fight
	    Against the irregular and wild Glendower,
	    Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken,
	    A thousand of his people butchered;
	    Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse,
	    Such beastly shameless transformation,
	    By those Welshwomen done as may not be
	    Without much shame retold or spoken of.

	KING HENRY IV

	    It seems then that the tidings of this broil
	    Brake off our business for the Holy Land.

	WESTMORELAND

	    This match'd with other did, my gracious lord;
	    For more uneven and unwelcome news
	    Came from the north and thus it did import:
	    On Holy-rood day, the gallant Hotspur there,
	    Young Harry Percy and brave Archibald,
	    That ever-valiant and approved Scot,
	    At Holmedon met,
	    Where they did spend a sad and bloody hour,
	    As by discharge of their artillery,
	    And shape of likelihood, the news was told;
	    For he that brought them, in the very heat
	    And pride of their contention did take horse,
	    Uncertain of the issue any way.

	KING HENRY IV

	    Here is a dear, a true industrious friend,
	    Sir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his horse.
	    Stain'd with the variation of each soil
	    Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours;
	    And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news.
	    The Earl of Douglas is discomfited:
	    Ten thousand bold Scots, two and twenty knights,
	    Balk'd in their own blood did Sir Walter see
	    On Holmedon's plains. Of prisoners, Hotspur took
	    Mordake the Earl of Fife, and eldest son
	    To beaten Douglas; and the Earl of Athol,
	    Of Murray, Angus, and Menteith:
	    And is not this an honourable spoil?
	    A gallant prize? ha, cousin, is it not?

	WESTMORELAND

	    In faith,
	    It is a conquest for a prince to boast of.

	KING HENRY IV

	    Yea, there thou makest me sad and makest me sin
	    In envy that my Lord Northumberland
	    Should be the father to so blest a son,
	    A son who is the theme of honour's tongue;
	    Amongst a grove, the very straightest plant;
	    Who is sweet Fortune's minion and her pride:
	    Whilst I, by looking on the praise of him,
	    See riot and dishonour stain the brow
	    Of my young Harry. O that it could be proved
	    That some night-tripping fairy had exchanged
	    In cradle-clothes our children where they lay,
	    And call'd mine Percy, his Plantagenet!
	    Then would I have his Harry, and he mine.
	    But let him from my thoughts. What think you, coz,
	    Of this young Percy's pride? the prisoners,
	    Which he in this adventure hath surprised,
	    To his own use he keeps; and sends me word,
	    I shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife.

	WESTMORELAND

	    This is his uncle's teaching; this is Worcester,
	    Malevolent to you in all aspects;
	    Which makes him prune himself, and bristle up
	    The crest of youth against your dignity.

	KING HENRY IV

	    But I have sent for him to answer this;
	    And for this cause awhile we must neglect
	    Our holy purpose to Jerusalem.
	    Cousin, on Wednesday next our council we
	    Will hold at Windsor; so inform the lords:
	    But come yourself with speed to us again;
	    For more is to be said and to be done
	    Than out of anger can be uttered.

	WESTMORELAND

	    I will, my liege.

	    Exeunt
	
	
	
		SCENE II. London. An apartment of the Prince's.

		    Enter the PRINCE OF WALES and FALSTAFF 

		FALSTAFF

		    Now, Hal, what time of day is it, lad?

		PRINCE HENRY

		    Thou art so fat-witted, with drinking of old sack
		    and unbuttoning thee after supper and sleeping upon
		    benches after noon, that thou hast forgotten to
		    demand that truly which thou wouldst truly know.
		    What a devil hast thou to do with the time of the
		    day? Unless hours were cups of sack and minutes
		    capons and clocks the tongues of bawds and dials the
		    signs of leaping-houses and the blessed sun himself
		    a fair hot wench in flame-coloured taffeta, I see no
		    reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand
		    the time of the day.

		FALSTAFF

		    Indeed, you come near me now, Hal; for we that take
		    purses go by the moon and the seven stars, and not
		    by Phoebus, he,'that wandering knight so fair.' And,
		    I prithee, sweet wag, when thou art king, as, God
		    save thy grace,--majesty I should say, for grace
		    thou wilt have none,--

		PRINCE HENRY

		    What, none?

		FALSTAFF

		    No, by my troth, not so much as will serve to
		    prologue to an egg and butter.

		PRINCE HENRY

		    Well, how then? come, roundly, roundly.

		FALSTAFF

		    Marry, then, sweet wag, when thou art king, let not
		    us that are squires of the night's body be called
		    thieves of the day's beauty: let us be Diana's
		    foresters, gentlemen of the shade, minions of the
		    moon; and let men say we be men of good government,
		    being governed, as the sea is, by our noble and
		    chaste mistress the moon, under whose countenance we steal.

		PRINCE HENRY

		    Thou sayest well, and it holds well too; for the
		    fortune of us that are the moon's men doth ebb and
		    flow like the sea, being governed, as the sea is,
		    by the moon. As, for proof, now: a purse of gold
		    most resolutely snatched on Monday night and most
		    dissolutely spent on Tuesday morning; got with
		    swearing 'Lay by' and spent with crying 'Bring in;'
		    now in as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder
		    and by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows.

		FALSTAFF

		    By the Lord, thou sayest true, lad. And is not my
		    hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench?

		PRINCE HENRY

		    As the honey of Hybla, my old lad of the castle. And
		    is not a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance?

		FALSTAFF

		    How now, how now, mad wag! what, in thy quips and
		    thy quiddities? what a plague have I to do with a
		    buff jerkin?

		PRINCE HENRY

		    Why, what a pox have I to do with my hostess of the tavern?

		FALSTAFF

		    Well, thou hast called her to a reckoning many a
		    time and oft.

		PRINCE HENRY

		    Did I ever call for thee to pay thy part?

		FALSTAFF

		    No; I'll give thee thy due, thou hast paid all there.

		PRINCE HENRY

		    Yea, and elsewhere, so far as my coin would stretch;
		    and where it would not, I have used my credit.

		FALSTAFF

		    Yea, and so used it that were it not here apparent
		    that thou art heir apparent--But, I prithee, sweet
		    wag, shall there be gallows standing in England when
		    thou art king? and resolution thus fobbed as it is
		    with the rusty curb of old father antic the law? Do
		    not thou, when thou art king, hang a thief.

		PRINCE HENRY

		    No; thou shalt.

		FALSTAFF

		    Shall I? O rare! By the Lord, I'll be a brave judge.

		PRINCE HENRY

		    Thou judgest false already: I mean, thou shalt have
		    the hanging of the thieves and so become a rare hangman.

		FALSTAFF

		    Well, Hal, well; and in some sort it jumps with my
		    humour as well as waiting in the court, I can tell
		    you.

		PRINCE HENRY

		    For obtaining of suits?

		FALSTAFF

		    Yea, for obtaining of suits, whereof the hangman
		    hath no lean wardrobe. 'Sblood, I am as melancholy
		    as a gib cat or a lugged bear.

		PRINCE HENRY

		    Or an old lion, or a lover's lute.

		FALSTAFF

		    Yea, or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe.

		PRINCE HENRY

		    What sayest thou to a hare, or the melancholy of
		    Moor-ditch?

		FALSTAFF

		    Thou hast the most unsavoury similes and art indeed
		    the most comparative, rascalliest, sweet young
		    prince. But, Hal, I prithee, trouble me no more
		    with vanity. I would to God thou and I knew where a
		    commodity of good names were to be bought. An old
		    lord of the council rated me the other day in the
		    street about you, sir, but I marked him not; and yet
		    he talked very wisely, but I regarded him not; and
		    yet he talked wisely, and in the street too.

		PRINCE HENRY

		    Thou didst well; for wisdom cries out in the
		    streets, and no man regards it.

		FALSTAFF

		    O, thou hast damnable iteration and art indeed able
		    to corrupt a saint. Thou hast done much harm upon
		    me, Hal; God forgive thee for it! Before I knew
		    thee, Hal, I knew nothing; and now am I, if a man
		    should speak truly, little better than one of the
		    wicked. I must give over this life, and I will give
		    it over: by the Lord, and I do not, I am a villain:
		    I'll be damned for never a king's son in
		    Christendom.

		PRINCE HENRY

		    Where shall we take a purse tomorrow, Jack?

		FALSTAFF

		    'Zounds, where thou wilt, lad; I'll make one; an I
		    do not, call me villain and baffle me.

		PRINCE HENRY

		    I see a good amendment of life in thee; from praying
		    to purse-taking.

		FALSTAFF

		    Why, Hal, 'tis my vocation, Hal; 'tis no sin for a
		    man to labour in his vocation.

		    Enter POINS
		    Poins! Now shall we know if Gadshill have set a
		    match. O, if men were to be saved by merit, what
		    hole in hell were hot enough for him? This is the
		    most omnipotent villain that ever cried 'Stand' to
		    a true man.

		PRINCE HENRY

		    Good morrow, Ned.

		POINS

		    Good morrow, sweet Hal. What says Monsieur Remorse?
		    what says Sir John Sack and Sugar? Jack! how
		    agrees the devil and thee about thy soul, that thou
		    soldest him on Good-Friday last for a cup of Madeira
		    and a cold capon's leg?

		PRINCE HENRY

		    Sir John stands to his word, the devil shall have
		    his bargain; for he was never yet a breaker of
		    proverbs: he will give the devil his due.

		POINS

		    Then art thou damned for keeping thy word with the devil.

		PRINCE HENRY

		    Else he had been damned for cozening the devil.

		POINS

		    But, my lads, my lads, to-morrow morning, by four
		    o'clock, early at Gadshill! there are pilgrims going
		    to Canterbury with rich offerings, and traders
		    riding to London with fat purses: I have vizards
		    for you all; you have horses for yourselves:
		    Gadshill lies to-night in Rochester: I have bespoke
		    supper to-morrow night in Eastcheap: we may do it
		    as secure as sleep. If you will go, I will stuff
		    your purses full of crowns; if you will not, tarry
		    at home and be hanged.

		FALSTAFF

		    Hear ye, Yedward; if I tarry at home and go not,
		    I'll hang you for going.

		POINS

		    You will, chops?

		FALSTAFF

		    Hal, wilt thou make one?

		PRINCE HENRY

		    Who, I rob? I a thief? not I, by my faith.

		FALSTAFF

		    There's neither honesty, manhood, nor good
		    fellowship in thee, nor thou camest not of the blood
		    royal, if thou darest not stand for ten shillings.

		PRINCE HENRY

		    Well then, once in my days I'll be a madcap.

		FALSTAFF

		    Why, that's well said.

		PRINCE HENRY

		    Well, come what will, I'll tarry at home.

		FALSTAFF

		    By the Lord, I'll be a traitor then, when thou art king.

		PRINCE HENRY

		    I care not.

		POINS

		    Sir John, I prithee, leave the prince and me alone:
		    I will lay him down such reasons for this adventure
		    that he shall go.

		FALSTAFF

		    Well, God give thee the spirit of persuasion and him
		    the ears of profiting, that what thou speakest may
		    move and what he hears may be believed, that the
		    true prince may, for recreation sake, prove a false
		    thief; for the poor abuses of the time want
		    countenance. Farewell: you shall find me in Eastcheap.

		PRINCE HENRY

		    Farewell, thou latter spring! farewell, All-hallown summer!

		    Exit Falstaff

		POINS

		    Now, my good sweet honey lord, ride with us
		    to-morrow: I have a jest to execute that I cannot
		    manage alone. Falstaff, Bardolph, Peto and Gadshill
		    shall rob those men that we have already waylaid:
		    yourself and I will not be there; and when they
		    have the booty, if you and I do not rob them, cut
		    this head off from my shoulders.

		PRINCE HENRY

		    How shall we part with them in setting forth?

		POINS

		    Why, we will set forth before or after them, and
		    appoint them a place of meeting, wherein it is at
		    our pleasure to fail, and then will they adventure
		    upon the exploit themselves; which they shall have
		    no sooner achieved, but we'll set upon them.

		PRINCE HENRY

		    Yea, but 'tis like that they will know us by our
		    horses, by our habits and by every other
		    appointment, to be ourselves.

		POINS

		    Tut! our horses they shall not see: I'll tie them
		    in the wood; our vizards we will change after we
		    leave them: and, sirrah, I have cases of buckram
		    for the nonce, to immask our noted outward garments.

		PRINCE HENRY

		    Yea, but I doubt they will be too hard for us.

		POINS

		    Well, for two of them, I know them to be as
		    true-bred cowards as ever turned back; and for the
		    third, if he fight longer than he sees reason, I'll
		    forswear arms. The virtue of this jest will be, the
		    incomprehensible lies that this same fat rogue will
		    tell us when we meet at supper: how thirty, at
		    least, he fought with; what wards, what blows, what
		    extremities he endured; and in the reproof of this
		    lies the jest.

		PRINCE HENRY

		    Well, I'll go with thee: provide us all things
		    necessary and meet me to-morrow night in Eastcheap;
		    there I'll sup. Farewell.

		POINS

		    Farewell, my lord.

		    Exit Poins

		PRINCE HENRY

		    I know you all, and will awhile uphold
		    The unyoked humour of your idleness:
		    Yet herein will I imitate the sun,
		    Who doth permit the base contagious clouds
		    To smother up his beauty from the world,
		    That, when he please again to be himself,
		    Being wanted, he may be more wonder'd at,
		    By breaking through the foul and ugly mists
		    Of vapours that did seem to strangle him.
		    If all the year were playing holidays,
		    To sport would be as tedious as to work;
		    But when they seldom come, they wish'd for come,
		    And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents.
		    So, when this loose behavior I throw off
		    And pay the debt I never promised,
		    By how much better than my word I am,
		    By so much shall I falsify men's hopes;
		    And like bright metal on a sullen ground,
		    My reformation, glittering o'er my fault,
		    Shall show more goodly and attract more eyes
		    Than that which hath no foil to set it off.
		    I'll so offend, to make offence a skill;
		    Redeeming time when men think least I will.

		    Exit
	
	
	
	
			SCENE III. London. The palace.

			    Enter the KING, NORTHUMBERLAND, WORCESTER, HOTSPUR, SIR WALTER BLUNT, with others 

			KING HENRY IV

			    My blood hath been too cold and temperate,
			    Unapt to stir at these indignities,
			    And you have found me; for accordingly
			    You tread upon my patience: but be sure
			    I will from henceforth rather be myself,
			    Mighty and to be fear'd, than my condition;
			    Which hath been smooth as oil, soft as young down,
			    And therefore lost that title of respect
			    Which the proud soul ne'er pays but to the proud.

			EARL OF WORCESTER

			    Our house, my sovereign liege, little deserves
			    The scourge of greatness to be used on it;
			    And that same greatness too which our own hands
			    Have holp to make so portly.

			NORTHUMBERLAND

			    My lord.--

			KING HENRY IV

			    Worcester, get thee gone; for I do see
			    Danger and disobedience in thine eye:
			    O, sir, your presence is too bold and peremptory,
			    And majesty might never yet endure
			    The moody frontier of a servant brow.
			    You have good leave to leave us: when we need
			    Your use and counsel, we shall send for you.

			    Exit Worcester
			    You were about to speak.

			    To North

			NORTHUMBERLAND

			    Yea, my good lord.
			    Those prisoners in your highness' name demanded,
			    Which Harry Percy here at Holmedon took,
			    Were, as he says, not with such strength denied
			    As is deliver'd to your majesty:
			    Either envy, therefore, or misprison
			    Is guilty of this fault and not my son.

			HOTSPUR

			    My liege, I did deny no prisoners.
			    But I remember, when the fight was done,
			    When I was dry with rage and extreme toil,
			    Breathless and faint, leaning upon my sword,
			    Came there a certain lord, neat, and trimly dress'd,
			    Fresh as a bridegroom; and his chin new reap'd
			    Show'd like a stubble-land at harvest-home;
			    He was perfumed like a milliner;
			    And 'twixt his finger and his thumb he held
			    A pouncet-box, which ever and anon
			    He gave his nose and took't away again;
			    Who therewith angry, when it next came there,
			    Took it in snuff; and still he smiled and talk'd,
			    And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by,
			    He call'd them untaught knaves, unmannerly,
			    To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse
			    Betwixt the wind and his nobility.
			    With many holiday and lady terms
			    He question'd me; amongst the rest, demanded
			    My prisoners in your majesty's behalf.
			    I then, all smarting with my wounds being cold,
			    To be so pester'd with a popinjay,
			    Out of my grief and my impatience,
			    Answer'd neglectingly I know not what,
			    He should or he should not; for he made me mad
			    To see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet
			    And talk so like a waiting-gentlewoman
			    Of guns and drums and wounds,--God save the mark!--
			    And telling me the sovereign'st thing on earth
			    Was parmaceti for an inward bruise;
			    And that it was great pity, so it was,
			    This villanous salt-petre should be digg'd
			    Out of the bowels of the harmless earth,
			    Which many a good tall fellow had destroy'd
			    So cowardly; and but for these vile guns,
			    He would himself have been a soldier.
			    This bald unjointed chat of his, my lord,
			    I answer'd indirectly, as I said;
			    And I beseech you, let not his report
			    Come current for an accusation
			    Betwixt my love and your high majesty.

			SIR WALTER BLUNT

			    The circumstance consider'd, good my lord,
			    Whate'er Lord Harry Percy then had said
			    To such a person and in such a place,
			    At such a time, with all the rest retold,
			    May reasonably die and never rise
			    To do him wrong or any way impeach
			    What then he said, so he unsay it now.

			KING HENRY IV

			    Why, yet he doth deny his prisoners,
			    But with proviso and exception,
			    That we at our own charge shall ransom straight
			    His brother-in-law, the foolish Mortimer;
			    Who, on my soul, hath wilfully betray'd
			    The lives of those that he did lead to fight
			    Against that great magician, damn'd Glendower,
			    Whose daughter, as we hear, the Earl of March
			    Hath lately married. Shall our coffers, then,
			    Be emptied to redeem a traitor home?
			    Shall we but treason? and indent with fears,
			    When they have lost and forfeited themselves?
			    No, on the barren mountains let him starve;
			    For I shall never hold that man my friend
			    Whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost
			    To ransom home revolted Mortimer.

			HOTSPUR

			    Revolted Mortimer!
			    He never did fall off, my sovereign liege,
			    But by the chance of war; to prove that true
			    Needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds,
			    Those mouthed wounds, which valiantly he took
			    When on the gentle Severn's sedgy bank,
			    In single opposition, hand to hand,
			    He did confound the best part of an hour
			    In changing hardiment with great Glendower:
			    Three times they breathed and three times did
			    they drink,
			    Upon agreement, of swift Severn's flood;
			    Who then, affrighted with their bloody looks,
			    Ran fearfully among the trembling reeds,
			    And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank,
			    Bloodstained with these valiant combatants.
			    Never did base and rotten policy
			    Colour her working with such deadly wounds;
			    Nor could the noble Mortimer
			    Receive so many, and all willingly:
			    Then let not him be slander'd with revolt.

			KING HENRY IV

			    Thou dost belie him, Percy, thou dost belie him;
			    He never did encounter with Glendower:
			    I tell thee,
			    He durst as well have met the devil alone
			    As Owen Glendower for an enemy.
			    Art thou not ashamed? But, sirrah, henceforth
			    Let me not hear you speak of Mortimer:
			    Send me your prisoners with the speediest means,
			    Or you shall hear in such a kind from me
			    As will displease you. My Lord Northumberland,
			    We licence your departure with your son.
			    Send us your prisoners, or you will hear of it.

			    Exeunt King Henry, Blunt, and train

			    An if the devil come and roar for them,
			    I will not send them: I will after straight
			    And tell him so; for I will ease my heart,
			    Albeit I make a hazard of my head.

			NORTHUMBERLAND

			    What, drunk with choler? stay and pause awhile:
			    Here comes your uncle.

			    Re-enter WORCESTER

			HOTSPUR

			    Speak of Mortimer!
			    'Zounds, I will speak of him; and let my soul
			    Want mercy, if I do not join with him:
			    Yea, on his part I'll empty all these veins,
			    And shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust,
			    But I will lift the down-trod Mortimer
			    As high in the air as this unthankful king,
			    As this ingrate and canker'd Bolingbroke.

			NORTHUMBERLAND

			    Brother, the king hath made your nephew mad.

			EARL OF WORCESTER

			    Who struck this heat up after I was gone?

			HOTSPUR

			    He will, forsooth, have all my prisoners;
			    And when I urged the ransom once again
			    Of my wife's brother, then his cheek look'd pale,
			    And on my face he turn'd an eye of death,
			    Trembling even at the name of Mortimer.

			EARL OF WORCESTER

			    I cannot blame him: was not he proclaim'd
			    By Richard that dead is the next of blood?

			NORTHUMBERLAND

			    He was; I heard the proclamation:
			    And then it was when the unhappy king,
			    --Whose wrongs in us God pardon!--did set forth
			    Upon his Irish expedition;
			    From whence he intercepted did return
			    To be deposed and shortly murdered.

			EARL OF WORCESTER

			    And for whose death we in the world's wide mouth
			    Live scandalized and foully spoken of.

			HOTSPUR

			    But soft, I pray you; did King Richard then
			    Proclaim my brother Edmund Mortimer
			    Heir to the crown?

			NORTHUMBERLAND

			    He did; myself did hear it.

			HOTSPUR

			    Nay, then I cannot blame his cousin king,
			    That wished him on the barren mountains starve.
			    But shall it be that you, that set the crown
			    Upon the head of this forgetful man
			    And for his sake wear the detested blot
			    Of murderous subornation, shall it be,
			    That you a world of curses undergo,
			    Being the agents, or base second means,
			    The cords, the ladder, or the hangman rather?
			    O, pardon me that I descend so low,
			    To show the line and the predicament
			    Wherein you range under this subtle king;
			    Shall it for shame be spoken in these days,
			    Or fill up chronicles in time to come,
			    That men of your nobility and power
			    Did gage them both in an unjust behalf,
			    As both of you--God pardon it!--have done,
			    To put down Richard, that sweet lovely rose,
			    An plant this thorn, this canker, Bolingbroke?
			    And shall it in more shame be further spoken,
			    That you are fool'd, discarded and shook off
			    By him for whom these shames ye underwent?
			    No; yet time serves wherein you may redeem
			    Your banish'd honours and restore yourselves
			    Into the good thoughts of the world again,
			    Revenge the jeering and disdain'd contempt
			    Of this proud king, who studies day and night
			    To answer all the debt he owes to you
			    Even with the bloody payment of your deaths:
			    Therefore, I say--

			EARL OF WORCESTER

			    Peace, cousin, say no more:
			    And now I will unclasp a secret book,
			    And to your quick-conceiving discontents
			    I'll read you matter deep and dangerous,
			    As full of peril and adventurous spirit
			    As to o'er-walk a current roaring loud
			    On the unsteadfast footing of a spear.

			HOTSPUR

			    If he fall in, good night! or sink or swim:
			    Send danger from the east unto the west,
			    So honour cross it from the north to south,
			    And let them grapple: O, the blood more stirs
			    To rouse a lion than to start a hare!

			NORTHUMBERLAND

			    Imagination of some great exploit
			    Drives him beyond the bounds of patience.

			HOTSPUR

			    By heaven, methinks it were an easy leap,
			    To pluck bright honour from the pale-faced moon,
			    Or dive into the bottom of the deep,
			    Where fathom-line could never touch the ground,
			    And pluck up drowned honour by the locks;
			    So he that doth redeem her thence might wear
			    Without corrival, all her dignities:
			    But out upon this half-faced fellowship!

			EARL OF WORCESTER

			    He apprehends a world of figures here,
			    But not the form of what he should attend.
			    Good cousin, give me audience for a while.

			HOTSPUR

			    I cry you mercy.

			EARL OF WORCESTER

			    Those same noble Scots
			    That are your prisoners,--

			HOTSPUR

			    I'll keep them all;
			    By God, he shall not have a Scot of them;
			    No, if a Scot would save his soul, he shall not:
			    I'll keep them, by this hand.

			EARL OF WORCESTER

			    You start away
			    And lend no ear unto my purposes.
			    Those prisoners you shall keep.

			HOTSPUR

			    Nay, I will; that's flat:
			    He said he would not ransom Mortimer;
			    Forbad my tongue to speak of Mortimer;
			    But I will find him when he lies asleep,
			    And in his ear I'll holla 'Mortimer!'
			    Nay,
			    I'll have a starling shall be taught to speak
			    Nothing but 'Mortimer,' and give it him
			    To keep his anger still in motion.

			EARL OF WORCESTER

			    Hear you, cousin; a word.

			HOTSPUR

			    All studies here I solemnly defy,
			    Save how to gall and pinch this Bolingbroke:
			    And that same sword-and-buckler Prince of Wales,
			    But that I think his father loves him not
			    And would be glad he met with some mischance,
			    I would have him poison'd with a pot of ale.

			EARL OF WORCESTER

			    Farewell, kinsman: I'll talk to you
			    When you are better temper'd to attend.

			NORTHUMBERLAND

			    Why, what a wasp-stung and impatient fool
			    Art thou to break into this woman's mood,
			    Tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own!

			HOTSPUR

			    Why, look you, I am whipp'd and scourged with rods,
			    Nettled and stung with pismires, when I hear
			    Of this vile politician, Bolingbroke.
			    In Richard's time,--what do you call the place?--
			    A plague upon it, it is in Gloucestershire;
			    'Twas where the madcap duke his uncle kept,
			    His uncle York; where I first bow'd my knee
			    Unto this king of smiles, this Bolingbroke,--
			    'Sblood!--
			    When you and he came back from Ravenspurgh.

			NORTHUMBERLAND

			    At Berkley castle.

			HOTSPUR

			    You say true:
			    Why, what a candy deal of courtesy
			    This fawning greyhound then did proffer me!
			    Look,'when his infant fortune came to age,'
			    And 'gentle Harry Percy,' and 'kind cousin;'
			    O, the devil take such cozeners! God forgive me!
			    Good uncle, tell your tale; I have done.

			EARL OF WORCESTER

			    Nay, if you have not, to it again;
			    We will stay your leisure.

			HOTSPUR

			    I have done, i' faith.

			EARL OF WORCESTER

			    Then once more to your Scottish prisoners.
			    Deliver them up without their ransom straight,
			    And make the Douglas' son your only mean
			    For powers in Scotland; which, for divers reasons
			    Which I shall send you written, be assured,
			    Will easily be granted. You, my lord,

			    To Northumberland
			    Your son in Scotland being thus employ'd,
			    Shall secretly into the bosom creep
			    Of that same noble prelate, well beloved,
			    The archbishop.

			HOTSPUR

			    Of York, is it not?

			EARL OF WORCESTER

			    True; who bears hard
			    His brother's death at Bristol, the Lord Scroop.
			    I speak not this in estimation,
			    As what I think might be, but what I know
			    Is ruminated, plotted and set down,
			    And only stays but to behold the face
			    Of that occasion that shall bring it on.

			HOTSPUR

			    I smell it: upon my life, it will do well.

			NORTHUMBERLAND

			    Before the game is afoot, thou still let'st slip.

			HOTSPUR

			    Why, it cannot choose but be a noble plot;
			    And then the power of Scotland and of York,
			    To join with Mortimer, ha?

			EARL OF WORCESTER

			    And so they shall.

			HOTSPUR

			    In faith, it is exceedingly well aim'd.

			EARL OF WORCESTER

			    And 'tis no little reason bids us speed,
			    To save our heads by raising of a head;
			    For, bear ourselves as even as we can,
			    The king will always think him in our debt,
			    And think we think ourselves unsatisfied,
			    Till he hath found a time to pay us home:
			    And see already how he doth begin
			    To make us strangers to his looks of love.

			HOTSPUR

			    He does, he does: we'll be revenged on him.

			EARL OF WORCESTER

			    Cousin, farewell: no further go in this
			    Than I by letters shall direct your course.
			    When time is ripe, which will be suddenly,
			    I'll steal to Glendower and Lord Mortimer;
			    Where you and Douglas and our powers at once,
			    As I will fashion it, shall happily meet,
			    To bear our fortunes in our own strong arms,
			    Which now we hold at much uncertainty.

			NORTHUMBERLAND

			    Farewell, good brother: we shall thrive, I trust.

			HOTSPUR

			    Uncle, Adieu: O, let the hours be short
			    Till fields and blows and groans applaud our sport!

			    Exeunt
